# FP Complete's Haskell Homepage

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/haskell.fpcomplete.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fpco/haskell.fpcomplete.com)

FP Complete is unifying all of its technology content under a single domain name, tech.fpcomplete.com. All the URLs that used to be live at https://haskell.fpcomplete.com/FOO now will be live at https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/FOO. This repo now simply provides automatic redirects.

In the future, we may move domains once more, merging with our corporate website (www.fpcomplete.com), but that hasn't been decided yet. If we do so, automatic redirects from tech.fpcomplete.com will be set up.
